This is [my][1]'s blog, built upon old [Hyde][2]. I intend to write about everything here, but first of all, I want to build it perfectly. This site has been and will be changed constantly until satisfied: a blog should be easy to use (for author), clean and focus on content (for reader).

My name is Yulong, a Chinese student pursuing a Master degree in Computer Engineering at Rutgers University.

I love spicy Chinese food, which makes me crazy to face burgers and steaks every single day. I love music, especially [Jazz Hiphop][3], [Punk][4] and [some awesome Chinese rock bands][5].

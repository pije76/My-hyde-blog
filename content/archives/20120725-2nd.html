Just bought a hosting plan and update my personal website, domain [yulongyang][1]. Now it is not available because of DNS configuration, but should be good after 24-48 hours. I still use plain old HTML/CSS files, while I do plan to convert it into another hyde of mine; hyde is nice to use and easy to write new posts. To make the design easier, I pick up the recently popular framework Twitter bootstrap. It looks quite nice to start with, also allowing me to customize it deeper in the future.

Just a feel of it:

Now this site is static. I used to love [Django][1], building everything upon it. Indeed, Django has a very rapid development process, support many plug-ins and great database access and most importantly, I still love Django. But building a blog using Django is just an overkill.

I mean, blog does have data, posts, and even more, authors, tags, as some crazy tutorials suggest. But essentially it is a content-focus static site; it does not need much of interaction and dynamic database access. It has been long time that I have this urge to convert my blog into a static site. Now I finally did it.

This blog builds upon static website generator [Hyde][2], old version with Django template language. Call me old fashion but I would not mind playing with Django a little more before finally moving to Jinja, the new template engine supported by [new Hyde][3].

So far so good. Finally you don't have to create database models, views, urls handlers just to create a place so that you could write down some meaningless thoughts. Also, for now, markdown beats the [rtf editor][4] I use for its simplicity and letting me blog in vim.

Now the site is using the default theme and template. My next step would be first tweaking the site to look readable, and then converting css files into sass; I am not sure sass is better than less, but it just got me with its ["css with attitude"][5]. Then from that, I grow my theme if possible.

I will still use Django for other web apps, but blog? Have some hyde!

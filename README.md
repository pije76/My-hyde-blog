##My static blog site##

This is my static blog site, built using [hyde](https://github.com/lakshmivyas/hyde). 
Note I use the old Hyde because I prefer Django template language but the new version of Hyde is based on Jinja.

It is still under development.

Some dependencies:
- [Fabric](http://docs.fabfile.org): create shorcuts for CLI commands
- cherrypy: use to run local server

All neccessary packages could be found in `requirements.txt`.
